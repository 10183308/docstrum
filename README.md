# Docstrum Algorithm
## Getting Started
This repo is for developing a Docstrum algorithm presented by Oâ€™Gorman (1993). The algorithm is built on top of the work by Chadoliver (https://github.com/chadoliver/cosc428-structor)

# Output
## Detected k-nearest neighbors
![Detected k-nearest neighbors](https://github.com/chulwoopack/docstrum/blob/master/output/test.png | width=20)
## Docstrum
![Detected k-nearest neighbors](https://github.com/chulwoopack/docstrum/blob/master/docstrums/test.png = 40x40)

# Note
## How to remove .DS_Store
```
find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete
```
